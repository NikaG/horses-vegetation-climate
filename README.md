# horses-vegetation-climate

This is the sort of repository we could create in github. We could store and modify code here as well as start discussions, etc. At the moment, this is set to public as I don't have a github subscription, but we could upgrade if you're concerned about keeping it private for now (or forever). We can also choose a license (optional) to go with the code which might be a good idea if it's kept public. 

Right now all that's here is an example of how the bash script might work. If we decide github isn't the right place for this, I can delete the repository :) - Jen
